## General info
This project is written in Spring and Angular with a local MySql database. It allows you to add, delete and edit users. It retrieves data from the database, or a single user can be displayed. The user's telephone number must consist of only 9 digits, with no pauses. User email must contain @. In the future, I plan to add Spring Security to the project, specifically the login of users (who are in the database). And for example Admin will have access to all previous functions and regular user will only be able to view the data
